#Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This is a repository for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project.

#Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the necessary skills involved in collecting and cleaning a raw dataset that can be used for subseqeunt analysis. Refer to the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) for a full description of the data set used in this project.

[The data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

#Project Summary

The goal of the project is to create a R script named run_analysis.R that does the following things:

1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measuerment.
3. Assigns descriptive names to the activities in the data set.
4. Assigns descriptive variable names to the data set.
5. Creates a second data set called TidyData.txt that has the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables and the run_analysis.R script in the CodeBook.MD file.
